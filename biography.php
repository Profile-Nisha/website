                <p>I studied printed textile design at Middlesex Polytechnic in the early 80's. When I graduated I began to design and hand paint my own ranges of bone china tableware. Then I worked under my maiden name of Doherty. I sold my work in Liberty and Thomas Goode in London, Henri Bendel and Bergdorf Goodman in New York and as far away as Japan. I also designed exclusive ranges for Marks and Spencer among others.</p><br>
                <p>In recent years I have returned to painting, the root of all my design work, and now concentrate predominantly on still life. I work in oils and occasionally watercolour. I like to paint simple objects from my home and strive to capture their essence. I am particularly interested in light and reflection.</p><br>
                <p>Iâ€™m primarily interested in the seasonal changes in my garden and the surrounding countryside, particularly the wild flowers and this has become the focus to my work. </p><br>
                <p>I live in rural East Sussex overlooking the beautiful Dudwell valley.</p>
